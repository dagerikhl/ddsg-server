/**
 * All of the objects generated by this method is supposed to follow the STIX 2 standard. This includes both the
 * objects and the relationships. This is restricted to the layout of STIX, and does not mean they will follow the
 * exact schema for ojects and relationships.
 *
 * The STIX 2 standard can be found here: https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro
 *
 * The relevant STIX Data Objects (SDOs) created by this method are:
 * 1. Attack Pattern: Represents an attack pattern as fetched from CAPEC.
 * 2. Course of Action: Represents a potential mitigation of an attack pattern.
 *
 * In addition, these custom Data Objects (DOs) will be included:
 * 3. Weakness: Represents a weakness as fetched from CWE.
 *
 * And the relevant STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) created by this method are:
 * 1. Relationship.
 *
 * @param objects Contains the filtered and unfiltered objects from data sources.
 * @param cb Used to relay the generated entities back to the calling function.
